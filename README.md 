# Hello, World! Python Application with Docker and CI/CD

This is a simple "Hello, World!" Python application containerized with Docker and set up with a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools installed on your local machine:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the application locally:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-hello-world-app.git
   cd my-hello-world-app
   
Build the Docker image:

bash docker build -t hello-world-app .

Run the Docker container:

docker run -p 80:80 hello-world-app

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost. You should see the "Hello, World!" message displayed as a web page.

CI/CD Pipeline
This project is configured with a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. The pipeline is triggered automatically when changes are pushed to the main branch. Here are the steps of the pipeline:

Build Docker Image: The application code is built into a Docker image.

Push Docker Image to Docker Hub: The Docker image is tagged and pushed to Docker Hub. Ensure you've set up the following secrets in your GitHub repository:

DOCKERHUB_USERNAME: Your Docker Hub username.
DOCKERHUB_TOKEN: A Docker Hub personal access token.

Deploy to Docker: The Docker container is run with the latest image on your server.

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment
Any changes pushed to the main branch will trigger the CI/CD pipeline.

To customize the pipeline or add more features, edit the .github/workflows/main.yml file.
